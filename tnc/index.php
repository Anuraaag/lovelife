        <h3>
            Site Terms and Conditions of Use
        </h3>
        Welcome to Site’s Terms and Conditions of Use (these “Terms”). This is a contract between you and the Website (as defined further below) and we want you to know yours and our rights before you use the application (“Website” or the “App”). Please take a few moments to read these Terms before enjoying the “Website” or the “App”, because once you access, view or use the “Website” or the “App”, you are going to be legally bound by these Terms (so probably best to read them first!).
        <ol>
            <li><strong>RULES</strong></li>
            <p>Before you can use the WebApp or App, you will need to register for an account (“Account”). In order to create an Account you must:
                <br>
                be at least 18 years old or the age of majority to legally enter into a contract under the laws of your home country; and be legally permitted to use the App by the laws of your home country.
                <br>
                You can create an Account via manual registration, or by using your Facebook/Google/Apple login details. If you create an Account using your Facebook/Google/Apple login details, you authorize us to access, display and use certain information from your Facebook/Google/Apple account (e.g. profile pictures, relationship status, location and information about Facebook/Google/Apple friends). For more information about what information we use and how we use it, please check out our Privacy Policy. By using our App, you acknowledge that we may collect and use of your data and information in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
                <br>
                Unfortunately, we cannot allow you to use another person’s Account or to share your Account with any other person without permission.
                <br>
                You’ll have great fun, but if you feel the need to leave, you can delete your Account at any time by going to the ‘Settings’ page when you are logged in and clicking on the ‘Delete account’ link. Your Account will be deleted immediately but it may take a little while for Your Content (defined below) to be completely removed from the App. Your profile information will be treated in accordance with our Privacy Policy. If you delete your Account and try to create a new account within this time period using the same credentials, we will re-activate your Account for you.
                <br>
                We use a combination of automated systems and a team of moderators to monitor and review accounts and messages for content that indicates breaches of these Terms. We reserve the right at our sole discretion to terminate or suspend any Account, restrict access to the App, or make use of any operational, technological, legal or other means available to enforce the Terms (including without limitation blocking specific IP addresses), at any time without liability and without the need to give you prior notice. Without limiting the foregoing in any way, we expressly reserve the right to terminate or suspend your Account without notice (1) for violating these terms, (2) due to your conduct on the App, or your conduct with other users of the App (including your “offline” conduct), if we, in our sole discretion, determine your conduct was inappropriate or improper, (3) if we or our affiliates, in our or their sole discretion, determine your conduct on other apps operated by our affiliates was inappropriate or improper, or (4) for any reasons whatsoever that we deem, in our sole discretion, justifies termination. If your Account is terminated or suspended, you agree you will not receive a refund for any paid service or features you have already been charged for.
                <br>
                You may not access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the App or our systems. Certain portions of the App may not be accessible if you have not registered for an Account.
                <li><strong>TYPES OF CONTENT</strong></li>
                <br>There are three types of content that you will be able to access on the App:

            <br>
            <p>Your Content</p>
            You agree that Your Content must comply with our Guidelines as updated from time to time. As Your Content is unique, you are responsible and liable for Your Content and will indemnify, defend, release, and hold us harmless from any claims made in connection with Your Content. Sorry that was a bit of a mouthful, but you are what you post!
            <br>
            You may not display any personal contact or banking information on your individual profile page whether in relation to you or any other person (for example, names, home addresses or postcodes, telephone numbers, email addresses, URLs, credit/debit card or other banking details). If you do choose to reveal any personal information about yourself to other users, whether via email or otherwise, it is at your own risk. We encourage you to use the same caution in disclosing details about yourself to third parties online as you would under any other circumstances.
            <br>
            As we are a public community, Your Content will be visible to other users of the App all around the world instantly - so make sure you are comfortable sharing Your Content before you post. As such, you agree that Your Content may be viewed by other users and any person visiting, participating in or who is sent a link to the App (e.g. individuals who receive a link to a user’s profile or shared content from other Users). By uploading Your Content on our platform, you represent and warrant to us that you have all necessary rights and licenses to do so, and automatically grant us a non-exclusive, royalty free, perpetual, worldwide license to use Your Content in any way (including, without limitation, editing, copying, modifying, adapting, translating, reformatting, creating derivative works from, incorporating into other works, advertising, distributing and otherwise making available to the general public such Content, whether in whole or in part and in any format or medium currently known or developed in the future).
            <br>
            We may assign and/or sub-license the above license to our affiliates and successors without any further approval by you.
            <br>
            We do not have any obligation to store Your Content - if it’s important, you should make a copy.
            <br>
            <p>Member Content</p>
            Other members of our team will also share content via the App. Member Content belongs to the user who posted the content and is stored on our servers and displayed via the App at the direction of the user providing the Member Content.
            <br>
            You do not have any rights in relation to other users’ Member Content, and you may only use other users’ personal information to the extent that your use of it matches our purpose of allowing people to meet one another.

We reserve the right to terminate your Account if you misuse other users’ information.
            <br>

            <li><strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong></li>
            <br>
            <ol>
                Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. Unless you opt out in the manner described in subsection 7 below, this agreement requires you to arbitrate disputes with us and limits the manner in which you seek relief from us.
                <li>
                    When Does This Arbitration Agreement Apply? This Arbitration Agreement applies to any dispute or claim relating to your use of our App or any other aspect of your relationship with us. It requires that, and by entering into these Terms you agree, that such claims will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (i) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify; and (ii) you or us may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights.
                </li>
                <li>
                    How Do You Start The Arbitration Process? To begin the arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent: CT Corporation, 1209 Orange Street, City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, Delaware 19801.
                </li>
                <li>
                    What Are The Rules Of Arbitration? The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.
                    <br>
                    You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
                <li>
                    What Can The Arbitrator Decide? The arbitrator has the exclusive authority to (i) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement, and (ii) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.
                </li>
                <li>
                    No Jury Trials. By agreeing to arbitration, YOU AND US ARE EACH AGREEING TO WAIVE OUR RIGHTS TO A COURT TRIAL. Instead, you and us are electing that all claims and disputes will be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as described in Section 13(1) above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.
                </li>
                <li>
                    One At A Time. All claims and disputes within the scope of this Arbitration Agreement MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR ANY OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING. Only individual relief is available, and claims of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated or consolidated with those of any other customer or user. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsection’s limitations as to a given claim for relief, then the claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the Courts located in Delhi, India. All other claims shall be arbitrated.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Survival of Agreement. The terms of this Arbitration Agreement will continue, even after your relationship with us has ended.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <li><strong>USE OF THIRD PARTY INTEGRATIONS</strong></li>
            <br>
            If you use the feature offered in our App or any other features provided by third party integrations, you will be subject to the third party Terms of Service, which contain an arbitration clause including a waiver of any right to participate in a class-action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration. If you do not agree to be subject to third party service, you should not use the service features within our App.
